# HK-s-Portfolio
Welcome to HK's Portfolio repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my web development projects, highlighting my skills and expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# About Me
I am a devoted software developer who has successfully finished a three-year Software Development course, giving me a good foundation in a wide range of technologies. My skill set includes SQL, Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML/CSS, PHP, and GitHub. 

As a hard worker, I make certain that duties allocated to me are finished on time, especially when faced with hurdles. I take pleasure in my ability to acquire new concepts and technology quickly. When faced with a challenge, I persevere and seek answers, whether via hard work or by asking aid from colleagues.
